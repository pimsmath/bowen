title: "Rufus Bowen's Notebook"
---

This website is dedicated to the memory of Rufus Bowen (1947-1978). On it, you
will find an interface to the 157 mathematical problems he left behind in his
notebook. This website was created to support [conference on Rufus' mathematical
legacy](https://pims.math.ca/events/170730-ctidsatmlorb) organized by the
[Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences](https://www.pims.math.ca).
It's mission was to continue the discussion of the problems left behind by Rufus
by allowing users to enter comments. Each problem has been deciphered and
is presented along with these comments on its current status. To
view a problem and previously entered comments, simply click on the problem
number below.
