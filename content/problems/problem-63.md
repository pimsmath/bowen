$C^r$ diffeos that are not $C^{r+1}$ qualitatively. Find a $C^1$ diffeo $f : V
\to V$ and a $C^1$ embedding $g:V \to M$ and $\tilde f$ extending $f$ to $M$
such that $\tilde f$ is $C^2$ on $M$, but $\tilde f |V$ is qualitatively not
$C^2$ (i.e. the qualitative behavior of $\tilde f|V $ is due to the
irregularity of $V$ but not of $\tilde f$)
