On the closure $\overline T$ of Teichm√ºller space, consider a continuous
parametrization $\overline T \times \Sigma_A^+ \to \mathbb S^2$ such that
Image ($t, \Sigma_A^+ = \Lambda(\Gamma_t)$). Is the Hausdorff dimension of
$\Lambda(\Gamma_t)$ continuous in $t \in \overline T$? (Note, this problem was
added by the editor to the end of Rufus' last paper
{{< cite bowen1979hausdorff >}})
