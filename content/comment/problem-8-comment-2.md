Related question: SRB measures for Henon maps which are not small
perturbations of 1-d maps. In particular computer assisted estimates of the
measure of SRB parameters near to Henon values a=1.4, b=0.3. Related question.
Computer assisted estimates of the measure of SRB parameters in the quadratic
family x->ax(1-x) for parameters not too close to a=4.
