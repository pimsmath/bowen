For the first question, there are uniquely ergodic homeomorphisms of T^2 with
positive entropy (https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0605/0605438v1.pdf) and
minimal analytic diffeomorphisms with positive entropy in dimension 4
(https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ergodic-theory-and-dynamical-
systems/article/div-classtitleconstruction-dandaposun-diffeomorphisme-minimal-
dandaposentropie-topologique-non-nullediv/5A88014D24F6C4CF8E114A3EFA13B920).
For a), Franks' semiconjugacy gives a negative answer: Take $F$ homotopic to
$(2111)\times id$ and a lift of $\hat F$ to $R^2 x R.$ If $\\{(x_n,t_n)\\}$ is
an $\hat F$ orbit, then $\\{x_n\\}$, its projection to $R^2$ is a bounded
pseudo-orbit for the linear map $(2111)$ acting on $R^2$. Therefore, there is
a unique orbit $\\{y_n\\}$ of $(2111)$ that shadows this pseudo-orbit. The map
$x_0 \mapsto y_0$ is continuous, equivariant and bounded distance from the
projection (therefore surjective). This is Franks' semiconjugacy which
descends to a map $h: T^2 \times S^1 \to T^2$. Now, the preimage of a fixed
(or periodic) orbit of $(2111)$ in $T^2$ will give a closed invariant subset
contradicting minimality.
