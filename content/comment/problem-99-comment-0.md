Keane and Smorodinsky showed that two aperiodic shifts of finite type are
finitarily isomorphic iff they have the same topological entropy ("The
finitary isomorphism theorem for Markov shifts", Bull. AMS 1 (1979)m 436-438).
One consequence is that an ergodic (algebraic) automorphism of the 2-torus has
a partition into sets with nonempty interior and bourdary of measure zero that
is an independent Bernoulli generator. The reference above to Bowen's paper
shows that in dimension 3 such a partition cannot be smooth.
