M. Misiurewicz {{< cite misiurewicz1973NoMME >}} built $C^r$ diffeomorphisms
without measures maximizing the entropy. These were the first known examples
of non entropy-expansive maps. Nowadays, it is easy to construct a real-
analytic example, e.g., the map $f:[-1,1]\to[-1,1]$, $x\mapsto 1-2x^2$.
Indeed, for any $\epsilon>0$, the "entropy below scale $\epsilon$" is
positive. This can be shown by considering an orbit visiting
$(-\epsilon/2,-\epsilon/4)\cup(\epsilon/4,\epsilon/2)$ with positive
frequency. On the other hand, the weaker property of asymptotic entropy-
expansiveness, i.e., that the "entropy below scale $\epsilon$" converges to
zero as $\epsilon$ goes to $0$, holds for every $C^\infty$-map of a compact
manifold and in particular for any real-analytic map {{< cite
buzzi1997intrinsic >}}. For more precise results, see {{< cite
yomdin1991analytic >}} and {{< cite burguet2015entropyRate >}}.
