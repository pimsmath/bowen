assuming we are talking about nielsens action of the mapping class group on
the circle at infinity...the only question that I recall makes sense is to
show this [ continuous even quasisymmetric ] action is not conjugate to a
smooth action [even C1 or even absolutely continuous] because the absolute
continuity is the obstruction to mostow rigidity in this dimension [ absolute
continuity holding for quasiconformal or quasi symmetric in higher
dim.yielding mostow rigidity]
