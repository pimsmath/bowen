There are Cr diffeomorphisms that are not Cr conjugated to a Cr+1
diffeomorphism J. Harrison, Unsmoothable diffeomorphisms. Ann. of Math. 102
(1975), 85–94. There exists a C∞ diffeomorphism of the annulus which preserves
a Lipschitz circle supporting a Denjoy counterexample. G. Hall, Bifurcation of
an attracting invariant circle: a Denjoy attractor. Ergodic Theory Dynam.
Systems 3 (1983), 87–118.
