Here $\Sigma_A$ is the shift of finite type defined by a square matrix $A$
with nonnegative integer entries. Let $A$ be $k\times k$. Presumably ``stable
$\mathbb R^n$'' is the subspace $V$ of $\mathbb R^k$ which is the eventual
range of $A$, that is, the intersection of the images of $A^j$ over $j>0$,
which equals the image of $A^k$. Restricted to $V$, $A$ is an invertible
linear transformation, classified by (for example) the nonnilpotent part of
the Jordan form of $A$. This data is a complete invariant of the shift
equivalence class of $A$ over $\mathbb R$, hence an invariant of the shift
equivalence class of $A$ over $\mathbb Z_+$, hence an invariant of topological
conjugacy for the shift of finite type $\Sigma_A$. Krieger's construction of
the dimension module (dimension group of $\Sigma_A$ with automorphism induced
by the shift) gives a descriptionwhich Bowen might have regarded as a more
intrinsic or ``invariant'' description of the shift equivalence class of $A$
over $\mathbb Z_+$. See Sections 7.4, 7.5 of {{< cite LindMarcus1995 >}} for
more on this, with background and references.
