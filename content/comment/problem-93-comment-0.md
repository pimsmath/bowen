So is the question: "Let $f$ be a homeomorphism of the circle (maybe a
specific two-slope example). For each $b$, define $f_b(x)=f(x)+b$. Say that
$f_b$ is ergodic with respect to Lebesgue if $f_b(A)=A$ implies $A$ has
measure 0 or 1 (no assumption of invariance of Lebesgue measure here). For a
fixed $f$, what can be said about the set of $b$ such that $f_b$ is ergodic?"
