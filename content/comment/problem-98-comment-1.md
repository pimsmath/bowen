Mark Pollicott and I have looked at the original notebook. The question seems
to say "U.e. in Lie group. Case with finite area instead of compact hom.
spaces" which we interpret as: "Unique ergodicity in Lie groups. Case with
finite area instead of compact homogeneous spaces" We will send higher
resolution pictures of this and the other illegible problems to Brian.
