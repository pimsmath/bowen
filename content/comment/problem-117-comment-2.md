MS implies eigen value statements the question is: up to isotopy does the
converse hold in the distal case. remark: for what its worth in my paper "
infinitesimal computations in topology" it is shown that up to isotopy not
every diffeo is a composition of morse smale.[uses algebraic group theory] but
this is true for surfaces.
