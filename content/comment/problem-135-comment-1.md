In my paper with Yitwah Cheung, we build a section to the horocycle flow on
$SL(2, \mathbb R)/SL(2, \mathbb Z)$ (which Pierre Arnoux also knew about) that
corresponds to what is known as the BCZ map, which looks something like an
infinite substitution system. This return map is known to be weak mixing
(unpublished work of Cheung and Quas), but there are probably many interesting
symbolic question about it.
