The conjecture is proven for C^1 Axiom A no cycle diffeomorphisms by Shub and
Williams and Ruelle and Sullivan. It has also been proven in general for
C^infinity endomorphisms of compact manifolds by Yomdin. For references,see
Shub,M., All,Most,Some Differentiable Dynamical Systems, in Proceedings of the
ICM,Madrid 2006.
