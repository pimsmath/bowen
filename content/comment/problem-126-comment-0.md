A zeta function for Smale flows that counted twisting in the local stable
manifolds of closed orbits was developed in my paper [1]. It only worked when
all the twisting was in the same sense. There exist Smale flows where
infinitely many closed orbits have the same twist. Followup papers [2,3,4] got
around this but the invariant was no long a function but an element of the
group ring ZZ/2. It generalizes the Parry-Sullivan number (that's Denise
Sullivan). It is not known if this new invariant is commutable in general. A
joint paper with Mike Boyle [5] showed the problem to be equivalent to the
unsolved problem of classifying square matrices over ZZ/2 - which is not a PID
ring. See also [6]. 1\. A zeta function for flows with positive template,
