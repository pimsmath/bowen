Something is known about minimality of strong foliations for partially
hyperbolic diffeomorphisms (see Bonatti-Diaz-Ures, Journal of the IMJ, 1
(2002) 513-541). However, minimality of the strong unstable foliation even for
Anosov of T^3 with 3-bundles (2-dimensional unstable) is open. Unique
ergodicity should (?) be understood with respect to 'transverse' invariant
measures. They always exist because unstable leafs have polynomial growth of
volume.
