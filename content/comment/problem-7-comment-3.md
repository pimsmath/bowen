(For part d.) Isolated invariant sets $\Lambda$ have non-unique "filtration
pairs", i.e. manifold neighborhoods $X$ with submanifold exit sets $E$ such
that $\Lambda$ is the maximal invariant set in $X \setminus E$. The map
induces a map on homology of the pair. The pairs are not unique and do not
have unique homology, but the maps on homology are all shift equivalent. Rufus
probably knew this and may have felt the shift equivalence class represented
"phantom homology," i.e., some homology intrinsic to the isolated invariant
set or basic set (see e.g. {{< cite franks1982homology >}}) The concept of
filtration pair was introduced in {{< cite bowen1977homology >}} where the
intent was to study dynamical systems satisfying Axiom~A. This concept is
related to the definition of index pair introduced by C. Conley, {{< cite
MR511133 >}}, and studied by several authors (see {{< cite easton1989isolating
>}}, {{< cite mrozek1990leray >}}, and {{< cite szymczak1995conley >}}). It is
significantly less general than the definition of index pair found in {{< cite
robbin1988dynamical >}}. All of these articles are interested in the
homological invariants one can obtain associated to a filtration pair. D.
Richeson and J. Franks in {{< cite franks2000shift >}}, show that shift
equivalence holds at the topological level (not just at the homology level).
