for a finitely generated kleinian group one knows[ I heard this much after i
left the area] that delta < 2 implies geometrically finite which implies the
result....see chris bishop et al...the analysis in the geometrically finite
case is in my papers ACTA...1980s without the finite generation it is very
false by direct and simple constructions in the classical book by R. Ford
"Automorphic Forms"
