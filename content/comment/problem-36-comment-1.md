A counterexample is given by a nonpositively curved connected compact surface,
such that the set of points with zero curvature is exactly a closed geodesic.
By results of Eberlein, or just by looking at the Poincare return map along
the geodesic, the geodesic flow on the unitary bundle of the surface is not
Anosov. On the other hand, we still have expansiveness because there is no
flat strip. In fact, there is still a product structure so the usual
topological properties of the flow hold.
