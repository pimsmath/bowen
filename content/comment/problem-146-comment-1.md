In parts a and d, "good quotient" probably means something like the quotient
dynamical system is expansive or hyperbolic and the quotient mapping is
finite-to-one or 1-1 a.e. (w.r.t. any fully supported ergodic measure). In
both a and d, it is too much to expect an SFT quotient; how about a sofic
quotient? See {{< cite adler1979topological >}} and {{< cite
boyle1987resolving >}}. In part c, $\mathcal{C}$ is a Markov partition for an
Axiom A basic set; the boundary of each element of $ \mathcal{C}$ is the union
of a stable boundary and unstable boundary, and the union of all stable
boundaries is denoted $\partial^s \mathcal{C}$. In part e, by aperiodic he
means mixing. Assuming a condition on the numbers of periodic points, Krieger
{{< cite krieger1982subsystems >}} proved existence of such an imbedding. See
also {{< cite boyle1983lower >}}.
