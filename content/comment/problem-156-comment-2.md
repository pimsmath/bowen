in my paper for kuipers 60 th birthday I produced a [socalled degenerate]
limit of quasi fuchsian groups which had a limit set of hausdorf dim two and
lebesgue measure zero , but positive hausdorf measure for a slightly bigger
gauge function with a heuristic argument that rr logloglogr worked...which i
recall was later proved by curt mcmullen.
