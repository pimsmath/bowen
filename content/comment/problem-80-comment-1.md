For surfaces it was shown by {{< cite Hiraide90 >}} and {{< cite Lewowicz89
>}} that there are no expansive homeomorphisms on the 2-sphere, that any
expansive homeomorphism of the 2-torus is conjugate to an Anosov
diffeomorphism, and for higher genus surfaces the expanisve homeomorphism is
conjuage to a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism.
