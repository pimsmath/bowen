This is true. Pick a complete transversal. If an invariant measure exists it
yields a Borel probability without atoms and with full support on the
transversal. The holonomy transformations preserve this measure and are
therefore equicontinuous. Uniqueness of the invariant measure then follows
from Shigenori Matsumoto's article "The unique ergodicity of equicontinuous
laminations" (2010, Hokkaido Mathematical Journal).
