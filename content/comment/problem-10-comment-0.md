For the $\beta$-transformations themselves (including nonlinear versions with
the same coding space), {{< cite Walters1978 >}} gives unique equilibrium
state for every Lipschitz potential; this was extended to Holder potentials in
{{< cite CT13 >}}. Of course general piecewise expanding interval maps have a
huge literature: in the transitive case, every Holder potential has a unique
equilibrium state provided it satisfies the condition $\sup_\mu \int
\phi\,d\mu < P(\phi)$, where the supremum is over all invariant measures.
Buzzi conjectured in {{< cite Buzzi2004 >}} that this holds for all Holder
potentials, and proved it when the map is continuous (not just piecewise
continuous). So far as I know the conjecture is still open even for the
examples $x\mapsto \alpha + \beta x \pmod 1$.
