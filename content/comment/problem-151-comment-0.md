By endowing the equivalence relation with a suitable topology, it becomes the
continuous orbit equivalence defined in [2]. It is completely classified in
[3]( see [1] for more general case including reducible case). The Krieger's
dimension group appears in the equivalence relation restricted to n=m. [1] T.
