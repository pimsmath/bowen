Often $\Sigma_A$ refers to a shift of finite type defined by a matrix $A$.
Perhaps then $\pi: \Sigma_A \to \mathbb T^2$ is a factor map from a mixing
shift of finite type onto a hyperbolic toral automorphism derived from some
Markov partition. Then he would be asking for something analogous to the
universal cover $p: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb T^2$. A natural candidate would
be the fiber product of $\pi$ and $p$, perhaps restricted to a suitable
subsystem. But, for what problem is this useful ...
