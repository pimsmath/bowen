To expand on Rodrigo's comment, the KMS paper does not prove it for all
irrational triangles but for ones which can be approximated well by rationals.
Here we should also mention Vorobets' work where he gives an explicit degree
of approximation for which you have ergodicity. Some triangles have optimal
dynamics- all orbits are either closed or uniformly distributed, which
corresponds to the Veech property of the associated translation surface. The
work of Kenyon-Smillie and Puchta classifies these.
