According to {{< cite KMS86 >}}, if the angles of the triangle are rational
multiples of $\pi$, the flow is uniquely ergodic in almost every direction. It
is also uniquely ergodic in almost every direction for other triangles whose
angles are not rational multiples of $\pi$ (again, from {{< cite KMS86 >}}).
