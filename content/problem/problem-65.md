Foliation ergodic theory Ambrose Kakutani (in particular, question 39) Does
mixing make any sense? (use category, differentiability, $C^\infty$, analytic
structure) Averaging procedure difficulties: ergodic theorems, existence of
invariant measures, ergodic decomposition, unique ergodicity and uniform
convergence. polynomial growth ... Look at some specific foliations Plante's
stuff on connections with homology Does pointwise entropy make sense?
