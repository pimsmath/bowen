Fibration Theorem for $\log |\lambda| $? If $M = \cup _\alpha N_\alpha,
N_\alpha $ submanifolds, with $f(N_\alpha ) = N_\alpha $, is the spectral
radius of $f_\ast $ on $M$ $\le$ the sup of the spectral radius of $f_\ast $
on $N_\alpha$'s? If $f|N_\alpha$ is an isometry, does the spectral radius of
$f_\ast $ on $M$ $= 1$? Are all distal diffeos built up this way, i.e. by
extensions where homology works? Note: There is another Problem 122 that was
crossed out.
