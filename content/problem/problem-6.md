Zeta function for Axiom A flows and systems topological identification (try
1-dimensional $\Omega $ first); conjugacy invariance of $\zeta (0)$. For
$C^\infty $ flows, $\zeta (s) $ has a meromorphic extension to the complex
plane. Connection with Laplacian vs. geodesic results; automorphic forms.
Anosov actions.
