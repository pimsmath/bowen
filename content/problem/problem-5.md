Homogenous dynamics Implications among unique ergodicity minimality entropy
zero plus ergodicity Simple or semi-simple case Which one-parameter subgroups
are unstable/stable foliations for some ergodic affine? Try a). Relate
dynamical properties to representations of the group. K-property implies
Bernoull? Weak mixing plus center s.s. implies Bernoulli? [For parts d and e,
try nilmanifolds first] Ergodic implies there is a unique measure of maximal
entropy?
