Subshifts of finite type have good quotients with fixed points. Given a
periodic point $p$ in $\Omega _i$, is there a Markov partition with $p$ in the
interior of a rectangle? If $\partial^s \mathcal{C} \ne \emptyset$ does
$\partial^s \mathcal{C}$ contain a periodic point? Do two subshifts of finite
type with the same entropy have a common good quotient? $\Sigma _A, \Sigma _B$
aperiodic, $h (\sigma _A ) < h(\sigma_B). $ Does $\sigma_A |\Sigma_A$ embed in
$\sigma_B |\Sigma_B$?
