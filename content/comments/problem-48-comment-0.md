Maybe the homeomorphism g is not required to be defined on $[0,1]$ but only on
$C$. Otherwize, $f\circ g$ is necessarily monotonous, and the answer of the
question would be trivially "no". Even with that the question still looks
strange: someone is able to state hypotheses making the question pertinent?
