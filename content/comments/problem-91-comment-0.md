Dropping the expanding condition (which cannot be satisfied on the interval),
on the set of continuous interval maps, the topological entropy is lower-
semicontinuous but not upper-semicontinuous {{< cite misiurewicz2001jumps >}}.
It is continuous among $C^\infty$ interval maps, as a consequence of Yomdin's
theory {{< cite yomdin1987volume >}}.
