David Koslicki and I wrote a paper in this spirit; see {{< cite MR3294965 >}}.
The question of finding “some potential” is exactly the right one. We obtained
a locally constant potential (depending on 3 symbols, thus giving a weight to
each nucleotide triplet) by training computationally against the data set
provided by the human genome. Of course, when Bowen wrote this note, neither
this data set nor the computational power required to train against it were
available. We also experimented with using the GC-content of each nucleotide
triplet to determine a potential function. We discuss different approaches to
selecting a potential in sections 3.7 and 3.8 of our paper. Speaking
personally, I find it fascinating that Bowen considered the possibility of
using the theory of equilibrium states in genomic analysis. I am well aware of
the great debt that the majority of my work owes to Bowen - I was unaware that
this idea was anticipated by him too!
