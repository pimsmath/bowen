In the setting where $G = SL(2, \mathbb R)$, Yitwah Cheung and I built a
section to the horocycle flow for $\Gamma = SL(2, \mathbb Z)$, and with Jon
Chaika and Samuel Lelievre built one for $\Gamma = \Delta(2, 5, \infty)$. This
construction was generalized by Uyanik-Work, and Sarig-Schmoll showed how to
realize the horocycle flow as a suspension flow over an adic transformation.
