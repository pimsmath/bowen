My memory is that stable ergodicity among perturbatins by left translation for
affine dynamics on homogenous spaces is equivalent to unique ergodicity of the
unstable foliation. But I don't remember why I think this. There is a
characterization by Starkov,A., Stable Ergodicity Among left Translations,
appendix to Pugh,C. and M.Shub, Stable Ergodicity, Bull.AMS (41) 1-41.
