For higher dimensions there are partial classifications. For expansive
homeomorphisms of compact 3-manifolds with dense topologically hyperbolic
periodic points the manifold is the 3-torus and the expansive homeomorphism is
conjugate to an Anosov diffeomorphism {{< cite Vieitez96 >}}. For the general
higher dimensional setting if an expansive homeomorphism has dense
topologically hyperbolic periodic points, then there exists a local product
structure for the homeomorphism on an open and dense set in the manifold.
Furthermore, if a hyperbolic periodic point for the expansive homeomorphism is
codimension-one, then the expansive homeomorphism is conjuage to a hyperbolic
toral automorphism {{< cite ABP09 >}}.
