Regarding (weaker) specification properties: The approach in [C.-Thompson
2012] has recently been extended (by C.--Fisher--Thompson) to some smooth
systems, including examples due to Mañé [arXiv:1703.05722], Bonatti-Viana
[arXiv:1505.06371], as well as (by Burns--C.--Fisher--Thompson) to geodesic
flows in nonpositive curvature [arxiv.org:1703.10878]. To my eye, the Mañé and
Bonatti-Viana examples share some significant features with the Abraham-Smale
and Simon examples. The main thing driving the approach in the preprints cited
above is that there is some region B such that the specification property
holds for orbit segments that spend "enough" time outside of B, so B in some
sense represents the "obstructions" to specification. Then if entropy of B is
smaller than total entropy, one gets a unique MME (modulo some other
technicalities), and a similar result holds for pressure and equilibrium
states. It seems reasonable to me to expect that a similar game could be
played with the Abraham-Smale and Simon examples, but I don't think anyone's
looked at this yet.
