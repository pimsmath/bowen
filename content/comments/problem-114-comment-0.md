This may be related to Theorem 5.3 of {{< cite bowen1977homology >}} and the
remark immediately following it. That result says that for a one-dimensional
Axiom A basic set $\Lambda$ with filtration pair $(X,E)$ the homology
$H_{u+1}(X,E, \mathbb S^1) \cong ker( I-A: T^n \to T^n),$ where $u$ is the
dimension of the unstable bundle of $\Lambda$ and $A$ is a signed Markov
partition matrix for $\Lambda$. If $det(I-A) \ne 0$ then it equals the order
of the group $ker( I-A: T^n \to T^n) \cong \mathbb Z^n / (I-A) \mathbb Z^n.$
The question would be to what extent similar results hold for higher
dimensional basic sets.
