A complete description of the specification properties of ergodic toral
automorphisms is given in "Ergodic group automorphisms and specification",
Douglas Lind, Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics 729 (1978), 93-104. Toral
automorphisms come in three flavors, depending on the behavior on the
generalized eigenspace for eigenvalues of modulus one (if any), and the
specification behavior is different for each flavor.
