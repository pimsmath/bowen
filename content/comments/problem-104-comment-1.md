The infinite product expression for $1/( 1 -t)$ is likely intended as a
homology zeta function (see {{< cite franks1985period >}}). L.-S. Young and J.
Franks in {{< cite franks1981c2 >}} construct a $C^1$ diffeo of $D^2$ with one
periodic point of period $2^n$ for each $n$. They are all saddles and there
are no other periodic points. The homology zeta function for this example
is$1/(1-t)$. Possibly Rufus was asking if this could be done $C^2$. The case
when the diffeo is $C^1$ was done in {{< cite MR0431282 >}}.
