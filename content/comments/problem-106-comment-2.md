I suspect that "flow conjugacy" here is intended to mean "flow equivalence"
since otherwise it would be the same as topological conjugacy and det(I -At)
is an invariant. For flow equivalence of subshifts of finite type, complete
invariants are known. If the shift is irreducible and non-trivial the
invariant for flow equivalence is the group BF(A) := Zn/(I-A)Zn together with
the integer det(I-A) (see {{< cite MR758893 >}} for the final part of the
proof and references). The multiplicity of 1 as an eigenvalue of A is the rank
of the free part of the group BF(A). So techically the answer to the first
question is yes the multiplicity of 1 is an invariant for irreducible SFTs.
The fact that BF(A) is an invariant is proved in {{< cite bowen1977homology
>}} based on results of Parry and Sullivan. Complete invariants are also known
for non-irreducible SFTs, but the answer is more complicated, see {{< cite
MR1907894 >}} for details and further references.
