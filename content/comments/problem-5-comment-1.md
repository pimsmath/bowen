Regarding a): if Gamma is cocompact, it is clear that unique ergodicity
implies minimality. If Gamma is nonuniform this implication is false, as was
shown in an example of Raghunathan described in my paper "Finite dimensional
representations and subgroup actions on homogeneous spaces," Israel Journal of
Mathematics, 106 (1998). The implication mimimality => unique ergodicity was
proved in my paper with Mozes, "Minimality and unique ergodicity for subgroup
actions," Annales de l'Institut Fourier 48, 5 (1998), but we had to assume
that the acting group was algebraic and that G is semisimple. These
assumptions were later relaxed in work of Starkov, which is described in his
survey paper with Kleinbock and Shah in the handbook of dynamical systems.
Regarding d): this was proved by Dani in "Kolmogorov automorphisms on
homogeneous spaces", Amer. J. Math. 98 (1976), under the assumption that G is
semisimple and the acting group element is diagonalizable over C.
