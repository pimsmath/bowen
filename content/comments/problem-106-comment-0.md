The answer to the second question is indeed no in the case that A has 1 as an
eigenvalue. For example, compare $\begin{pmatrix} 2&1\\\2&3 \end{pmatrix}$ and
$\begin{pmatrix} 2&1\\\1&2 \end{pmatrix}$. For the first question, note: the
multiplicity of 1 as an eigenvalue of A means the dimension of the eigenspace,
which can be smaller than the mutliplicity of 1 as a root of the
characteristic polynomial of A.
