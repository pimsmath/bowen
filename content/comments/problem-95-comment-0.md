Problem 95: I think that then problem I discussed with Rufus referred to his
very natural version of the proof of the rationality of the zeta function for
Axiom A using a Markov partition. Can one imitate this proof for the Weil zeta
function of a manifold M over a finite field (with periodic points for
Frobenius replacing periodic points for hyperbolic diffeo)? I.e. can one find
in a natural way a “Markov Partition” on M?
