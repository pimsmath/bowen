biblio_abstract: 'This survey gives an account of an algebraic construction of symbolic
  covers and representations of ergodic automorphisms of compact abelian groups, initiated
  by A.M. Vershik around 1992 for hyperbolic automorphisms of finite-dimensional tori.
  The key ingredient in this approach, which was subsequently extended to arbitrary
  expansive automorphisms of compact abelian groups, is the use of homoclinic points
  of the automorphism.

  Although existence and abundance of homoclinic points is intimately connected to
  expansiveness of the automorphism, it is nevertheless possible to extend certain
  aspects of this construction to nonexpansive irreducible automorphisms of compact
  abelian groups (like irreducible toral automorphisms whose dominant eigenvalue is
  a Salem number). The later sections of this survey discuss the phenomena and problems
  arising in this extension.
